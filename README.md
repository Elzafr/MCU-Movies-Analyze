# MCU-Movies-Analyze
Overview
This repository contains Python code and data for performing data analysis on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies. The analysis focuses on three main areas: data visualization, box office prediction modeling, and movie score analysis.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. The dataset includes information about MCU movies, including box office earnings, release dates, and critical scores.

scripts: This directory contains the Python scripts used for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that provide step-by-step walkthroughs of the analysis process. These notebooks are named and organized by the specific analysis they cover.

Data Visualization
The data visualization part of the analysis aims to provide insights into the MCU movies' performance over time. Visualization techniques such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots are used to illustrate trends in box office earnings, movie release dates, and critical scores. To explore the data visualization analysis, refer to the notebooks in the "notebooks" directory:

data_visualization.ipynb: This notebook provides a detailed exploration of data visualization techniques used in the analysis.
Box Office Prediction Modeling
The box office prediction modeling part of the analysis focuses on building a predictive model for estimating the box office earnings of future MCU movies. Various machine learning algorithms are explored, and the model's performance is evaluated using historical data. To understand and replicate the box office prediction modeling, refer to the notebooks in the "notebooks" directory:

box_office_prediction.ipynb: This notebook guides you through the process of building and evaluating the box office prediction model.
Movie Score Analysis
The movie score analysis examines the critical and audience scores of MCU movies and identifies factors that may influence these scores. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations are used to gain insights into how movie scores have evolved over time. To delve into the movie score analysis, refer to the notebooks in the "notebooks" directory:

movie_score_analysis.ipynb: This notebook explores the analysis of critical and audience scores for MCU movies.
